Explanation of Code and Its Purpose
1. Login Transaction (Class Login):

    The Login class encapsulates the logic for logging into the application.
    It inherits from AbstractTransaction and implements the do method.
    The do method performs the login operation, including navigating to the URL, entering the username and password, and clicking the login button. It then returns the current URL, which can be used to verify if the login was successful.

2. Assertion (Class VerifyLoginSuccess):

    This class implements the IAssertion interface from Guará to verify that the login was successful.
    It checks whether the current URL matches the expected URL after login, which is stored in os.getenv("URL") + "/inventory.html".

3. TestLogin Class:

    The TestLogin class uses the Guará framework to perform the login action.
    The test_login_ok method runs the Login transaction and then applies the VerifyLoginSuccess assertion to ensure that the URL after login matches the expected one.

Purpose of the Code Selection

The Guará team selected this code to validate the framework's capabilities because it demonstrates the following key features:

    Page Transactions Pattern:
        The code effectively follows the Page Transactions Pattern by encapsulating the login functionality into a Login transaction, where the do method performs the actual login operation and returns a result (the current URL).
        This makes it easy to extend the framework with other transactions (e.g., logout, search, etc.) by creating new classes that inherit from AbstractTransaction.

    Modularity and Extensibility:
        The use of separate classes for the login transaction (Login) and the assertion (VerifyLoginSuccess) demonstrates the modularity of the framework.
        If new actions or assertions are needed, they can be added without modifying the core framework, aligning with the Guará philosophy of extensibility.

    Test Orchestration with Guará:
        The Application class is used to orchestrate the test, where the login transaction is executed with app.at(Login, browser, username, password) and the assertion is applied using app.asserts(VerifyLoginSuccess(), result, expected_url).
        This simplified orchestration allows the test logic to be written in a clean and readable manner, showcasing the power of the Guará framework in orchestrating test automation.

    Testability and Maintenance:
        The code maintains a clean separation of concerns by separating the transaction (Login) and assertion logic (VerifyLoginSuccess) from the test logic itself.
        This makes the code easier to maintain and extend, as each component (transaction, assertion, test) is isolated.

    Real-World Use Case:
        The code is a real-world example of a login functionality test. It interacts with a webpage, performs user authentication, and validates the result. This aligns with common UI test automation scenarios, making it a valid use case for testing the capabilities of the Guará framework.

    Integration with Allure:
        The code integrates with Allure for reporting, using decorators like @allure.feature, @allure.story, and @allure.severity to enhance test reporting. This is important for visualizing test results and improving the test feedback process.

By using this code, the Guará team demonstrates how the framework can be employed in real-world scenarios to simplify UI test automation, ensuring that tests are modular, maintainable, and easy to extend. The framework also helps in handling repetitive tasks, such as interactions with web elements and performing assertions, in a concise and readable manner.
